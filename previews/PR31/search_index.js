TMLE is a framework for efficient estimation that was first proposed by Van der Laan et al in 2006. If you are new to TMLE, this review paper  gives a nice overview to the field. Because TMLE requires nuisance parameters  to be learnt by machine learning algorithms, this package is built on top of  MLJ. This means that any model  respecting the MLJ interface can be used to estimate the nuisance parameters.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"note: Note\nThis package is still experimental and documentation under construction","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"julia> add TMLE","category":"page"},{"location":"#Get-in-touch","page":"Home","title":"Get in touch","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Please feel free to fill an issue if you want to report any bug or want to have additional features part of the package.
